Text:

Since the concept of a memex or "Memory Index" predates the internet, any instance of one is an interpretation. In the minimalist interpretation, a memex might be described, simply, as a **personal wiki**, though with most hypothetical proto-computing, proto-hypertext, or proto-internet imaginings a *simple* description seems reductive. As a hypothetical idea, a memex is an intimate personal digital assistant connecting the user to their media and the information they acquire.

This wiki is a catalog of notes and references I've found useful to record. It's is a living system and as such it will always be incomplete - a work in progress... and *I'm okay with that*. The balance between personal and private, promotional and informal, informative and editorial create an interesting tension in this project. The challenges this creates I hope to find solutions for with design, standardization, and repetition.
