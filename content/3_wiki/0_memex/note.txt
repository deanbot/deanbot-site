Since the concept of a memex predates the internet, any instance of one is an interpretation. In the minimalist interpretation a  memex might be described simply as a **personal wiki** though with most hypothetical proto-computing, proto-hypertext, or proto-internet imaginings a *simple* description seems reductive. As a hypothetical idea, a memex is an intimate personal digital assistant connecting the user to their media and the information they acquire.

This wiki is a digital playground and catalog of notes and references I've found useful to record. It's is a living system and as such it will always be incomplete - a work in progress.. and *I'm okay with that*.
