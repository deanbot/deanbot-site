*Thank Anya for this!*

(15-20 min prep, 10-15 min cook time)

**DON'T FORGET THE LIME & FRESH BASIL**

### Ingredients

- 1.25 lb ground beef
- 3 red chilies
- 1 can coconut milk (or approx 1.5 cups)
- limes (.5 per/person)
- rice (1.25 C basmati or jasmine)

See prep notes for quantities:

- Thai (or other) basil (few bunches)
- onion (1 sm-medium onion)
- ginger (at least 2 in. or so)
- garlic
- brown sugar
- soy sauce or ponzu
- fish sauce
- coconut oil

### Prep work

- minced ginger
- minced onion
- minced garlic
^ a few tablespoons of each of above, or more.
- mince chilies
^ combine and set aside.

In a small bowl or ramekin combine: two tablespoons plus one teaspoon, each, of soy sauce/ponzu and fish sauce, with one heaping tablespoon brown sugar... stir and set aside.

Roughly chop approx. 1 cup (or more, or just a heaping handful) of fresh basil; it would be difficult to have too much & set aside.

### Start the rice

Rinse rice in saucepan... add coconut milk, ¾ cup water, and 1 Tbsp coconut oil; bring to boil, cover & reduce to simmer etc. Stir often! Takes less time than normal rice (~10 min). Do not burn!

### Cook the beef

Once the rice water is on its way, put skillet or wok on high heat...

Once heated, add garlic-ginger-onion-chili mixture with 2-3 tablespoons of oil. Stir constantly for 30 seconds to one minute. Add ground beef & brown (4-6 minutes)...

Add the soy-stuff, cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute more...

Reduce the heat to med-low, add basil & stir until it wilts very slightly (20 seconds? it’s quick).

& done.

### Serve

Spoon into bowls with coconut rice.
DO serve with lime wedges, essential final addition

*Adapted from the age-old culture of Thailand, also Martha Stewart*

### Variations

- Use ground bison
- Use black rice
