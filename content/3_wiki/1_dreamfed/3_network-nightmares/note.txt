## Gameplay

Played from the POV of a hacker, the gameplay includes slingshotting projectiles or "viruses" at targets, aka "network nodes". Hitting a node with a virus "infects" it, and alerts ai entities, aka "network admins". Network admins follow paths to infected nodes and work to recover them. Infecting a "hub" node infects all connected nodes at once. The goal of each level is to infect all nodes on a network before the network admins can recover them.

A secondary mechanic deals with the "lives" or available viruses the player has. The player starts with 3 viruses. When a node is infected with a virus the player slowly accumulates additional viruses at their disposal. The more infected nodes, the more rapidly viruses are awarded. The player loses when they run out of viruses.
