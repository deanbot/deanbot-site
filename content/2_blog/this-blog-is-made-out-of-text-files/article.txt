Title: This blog is made out of text files

[Kirby](https://getkirby.com/), the CMS I chose for this blogging website, forgoes the traditional database-centric approach to storing content in favor of a simpler, file-based, option which stores data in simple `.txt` files. It doesn't store html either, but instead, content is saved (and authored) in markdown. Leaving performance benefits aside (enhanced with SSD hosting and further with caching enabled), this method makes trivial the task of synchronizing local and remote environments. In other words, synchronizing the *content* is done like any other file. This lack of complexity and separation allows me to use a unified process for updating programming *and content* with simple, ubiquitous, tools like rsync and [ssh]http://spiritedrefactor.localhost/wiki/reference/ssh).

## Synchronizing files with rsync

**Rsync** allows me to step through all the files in a (mark: source) and (mark: target) keeping only the latest versions. I can preserve permissions and ownership (`-a`). I can transfer files quickly with compression (`-z`). If I'm confident in a particular source I can delete any extraneous files in my target (`--delete`). I can configure files and directories to ignore (`--exclude-from`), and execute a dry-run to see what will change (`n`).

The [.sync](https://github.com/deanbot/spiritedrefactor-site/tree/master/.sync) directory in my repo for this  site contains reusable implementations of these commands. After adding configuration storing my destination ssh connection info (not checked in) I can run the [sync-up.sh](https://github.com/deanbot/spiritedrefactor-site/blob/master/.sync/sync-up.sh) or [sync-down.sh](https://github.com/deanbot/spiritedrefactor-site/blob/master/.sync/sync-down.sh) helper scripts.

```sh
$ .sync/sync-up.sr

```

In my local computer I can create any aliases or symlinks I want to cut this command down to mere keystrokes.
